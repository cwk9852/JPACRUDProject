Tea artisans use various methods of firing the freshly harvested tea leaves to prevent the natural oxidation process and preserve the fresh green aspect of the leaf.

Of all the types of tea, white teas are the least processed. They are characterized by delicate flavors, a smooth mouthfeel, and a subtly fruity, sweet finish.\nWhite teas tend to have less bitterness than other teas, and can be more forgiving of water temperature and infusion times than green teas. Rishi Tea offers several pure white teas as well as signature white teas blended with fragrant herbs and botanicals.\n\nMost white teas are made from medium-leaf tea bush varieties that yield silvery-white sprouts and leaves. They are delicately hand-harvested only once a year, for a few weeks in early spring when the weather is consistently cool and dry. The withering process of white tea raises an abundance of silvery-white hairs on the dried tealeaves and buds. Authentic white teas such as White Peony are multi-colored like autumn leaves, and are covered with a silver-white \"down\" that resembles the skin of a ripened peach. Silver Needle, the premier style of white tea, consists of only silvery-white sprouts shaped like needles without attached leaves. White teas take their name both from their appearance and from the original Fujian tea bush varieties selected for the production of white tea. These medium-leaf tea bushes include \"Fuding Da Hao\" (Fuding County\'s Big Silvery-Hair) and \"Fuding Da Bai\" (Fuding County\'s Big White).\n\nGeographically, white tea originated north of the Min River in China\'s Fujian Province in the town of Zhenghe. While many white teas are still produced in Zhenghe today, others are produced in nearby Fuding. In fact, over the last decade, new types of white tea have emerged in many areas outside of Fujian. One of our favorite new origins for white tea is Yunnan Province, where leaves destined to be made into white tea are harvested from ancient heirloom assamica variety trees. Depending on prevailing weather and seasonal character, Rishi Tea produces white teas in Zhenghe, Fuding, and Yunnan. We offer single farm micro-lots as well as exclusive varietal and multiple-farm blends of organic white teas.');

The production methods of oolong tea are known only to a few of the tea cultivation regions in the world. \nThe oolong tea process was developed in the Fujian Province of southeastern China, within the Wuyi Mountains. It was originally called Qing Cha (bluegreen tea) and later was dubbed Oolong Cha (\"black dragon tea,\" also spelled Wulong Cha) by the 18th Century Qing Dynasty Emperor, Qianlong. Since then the world of oolong tea has expanded but the main production zones of oolong today consist of Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan. \n\nThe intention of the oolong maker is to partially oxidize the leaf, utilizing special withering, bruising, rolling, oxidation and repeated roasting techniques to fix the aroma and color of oolong. \n\nThe result is a tea that on the scale of leaf oxidation and infusion color is somewhere between green and black tea. Depending on the duration of oxidation, season, regional style, tea bush varietal and roast degree, the resulting infusion colors of oolong teas range from lightly oxidized bright green or golden, to more heavily oxidized hues of amber-orange, to reddish and heavily roasted dark coffee-brown. \n\nOolong tea production is the most skilled labor intensive, artisanal and sophisticated manner of tea making. Oolong tea artisans are much like boutique wine makers. Most oolong teas are sold under simple trade names (e.g., Tie Guanyin, Shui Xian, Dong Ding, Dancong) but experts categorize and understand oolong by its region, vintage, bush varietal and season of harvest, just like wine. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we can say there are hundreds of types of oolong. \n');

Unlike green tea processing, which attempts to preserve the green color of fresh tea leaves, black tea processing encourages fresh tea leaves to oxidize and change color from green to coppery red. This change in leaf color during processing is referred to as oxidation.\n\nThe basic steps of black tea processing are picking, withering, tumbling, rolling, oxidation and drying. Based on the region, style and level of oxidation, black teas can be of a light yellow, orange, red or dark infusion color. ');

Like Champagne or other regionally specific foods and beverages, pu\'er is a geographically indicated (GI) product, and it can only be produced and fermented in Southern Yunnan with sun-dried green tea from certain tea varietals found in Yunnan, Laos, Burma and some parts of Thailand and Vietnam. Pu\'er tea, with its unique bold and earthy character, is becoming very popular all over the world as a health and wellness tea.
